This project was a big challenge but I believe I managed to finish it properly. With the help of Mikhail I was able to find some commands posted through the Slack and I also found help in classes recorded by himself. I emphasize the importance of the teacher for making his help available and below it is possible to find the links used by me for searching so that I could have completed this project.

I uploaded this video on YouTube showing you my Ionic Application working on my iPhone because it was not working properly on Safari or Google Chrome.
